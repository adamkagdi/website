<h1>Adam Kagdi's Website</h1>

<h2>Why Have I made this website?</h2>
<p>I have made this website so I look cool online and also I don't want to become a <strong>web peasant</strong>.</p>

<h2>Why not a <strong>web peasant</strong>?</h2>
<ol>
	<li>I can look cool</li>
	<li>An evidence for me knowing HTML and CSS</li>
	<li>This shows up on google instead of my Twitter or Instagram</li>
	<li>I was bored</li>
</ol>
